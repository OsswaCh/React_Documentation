## Short answer

no we cannot do it directly.
we might be able to use a [capacitor](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/16pzx8g/is_there_a_goto_way_to_convert_your_react_app/). [View this](https://medium.com/how-to-react/convert-your-existing-react-js-app-to-android-or-ios-app-using-the-ionic-capacitor-a127deda75bd)


## What is the problem with the DOM?

the biggest problems of inserting elements into the [[Intro to react __Syntax__]] DOM with JavaScript is that the code is not reusable. For example, if you want to insert the same button into the page, but with different background colors, you have to create the element twice in JavaScript

## How React fixes it?

React is used to build all the parts of a website that the user can see and interact with on their browser window (front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.). React makes the process of designing the user interface much easier. It allows you to create elements that you can easily re-use in other parts of the website or app.

Another benefit of using React for UI development is separation of concerns. This means that the data used in a component exists separately from the logic, which exists separately from the view layer.

example:

```jsx
const Button (props) => {
	// component data
    const [btnText, setBtnText] = useState("Submit")
    
    // component logic
    function onClick() {
    	setBtnText("Submitted!")
    }
    
	return (
    	// component view
    	<div>
        	<button style={props.color}>{btnText}</button>
        </div>
    )
}
```

## Difference from React native

- React JS is used to build the user interface of web applications (that is, apps that run on a web browser)
- React Native is used to build applications that run on both iOS and Android devices (that is, cross-platform mobile applications)
- React uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create interactive user interfaces. React Native, on the other hand, uses native UI components and APIs to create mobile apps.

React Native was created as a way for developers to build cross-platform mobile applications using their existing knowledge of web development tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the React core library.

**Things that are the same or translate over well from React Web to React Native**

- Core React concepts. Component lifecycle, composition, etc.
    
- React architectural concepts. State management, orchestrating HTTP requests.
    
- Performance optimization techniques that are specific to React.
    
- Many tools for monitoring, error reporting, analytics, etc. have SDKs that translate over well (I'm thinking Sentry, Datadog, others).


**Things that are different between React Web and React Native:**

- Styling. CSS concepts translate over, but the CSS engine is basic compared to browser support.
    
- Library availability. Pure JS libs all translate over (e.g., lodash, axios, etc). CSS-based UI libs don't make sense on mobile; your new options include NativeBase, React Native Elements and others). Some web-based UI libs do have RN siblings though - react-native-material for example, Tailwind. important to our app, Tailwind is not stable on react native, thus we will have to use something like react native styled components
    
- Mobile hardware can do things browsers can't, so that's a perk. But also new learning.
    
- Navigation. react-navigation is the standard for mobile, which is very different from react-router, Next.js's router, and so on.
    
- Development and DX. Some tools are similar (Chrome debugger, mostly), but other things are very different (working with the bundler, Flipper, AsyncStorage debugging, more). Some techniques you use are the same (breakpoints and console logging), but others are different (knowing when to restart the packager vs reinstall the app on device).
    
- Releases. You can deploy to prod without restriction on web; on mobile you have to deal with both app stores, which can be cumbersome and slow especially for the initial release/approval process.
    
- CI/CD are a different animal.
    
- Testing: unit testing with Jest is similar; E2E testing is completely different.
    
- Performance optimization: besides React optimization (which is arguably more necessary on mobile), you now have different hardware and a different internal architecture. You have to know about the JS and UI threads, and different (and IMO more challenging) ways to avoid jank and prevent crashing.
 
## why you shouldn't build an app using React JS


### 1. **Performance Issues**

- **Web vs. Native**: React.js applications run within a web browser, which adds a layer of abstraction between the app and the device's hardware. This can lead to slower performance compared to native mobile apps, which are compiled directly to native code.
- **Resource Consumption**: Web apps generally consume more memory and processing power compared to native apps, leading to potential issues on devices with limited resources.

### 2. **User Experience**

- **Look and Feel**: Mobile users expect apps to look and feel like native applications. React.js-based apps often don't match the native UI and UX standards, which can result in a subpar user experience.
- **Responsive Design Limitations**: While React.js supports responsive design, it can be challenging to achieve the same level of responsiveness and fluidity as native apps, especially for complex interactions and animations.

### 3. **Access to Native Features**

- **Limited API Access**: Web apps have limited access to device hardware and features, such as GPS, camera, sensors, and more. While some of these can be accessed through web APIs, the functionality is often more restricted and less efficient than native APIs.
- **Offline Functionality**: Native apps can provide better offline support and functionality compared to web apps, which rely heavily on internet connectivity.

### 4. **Development Tools and Ecosystem**

- **React.js vs. React Native**: React Native is specifically designed for building mobile applications using React. It allows developers to write mobile apps that are truly native but still use the same React.js principles. React Native provides components and APIs that map directly to native UI components, ensuring better performance and user experience.
- **Build Tools**: React.js development relies on tools optimized for web development (e.g., Webpack, Babel), while mobile app development benefits from mobile-specific tools (e.g., Xcode, Android Studio).

### 5. **App Store Policies**

- **Acceptance Issues**: Some app stores may have policies that discourage or limit the use of web-based technologies for mobile apps. Native or near-native technologies (like React Native) are generally more acceptable.
## Reasons Not to Use React Native for Web Platform Development

1. **Performance Concerns**
    
    - **Overhead**: React Native components might add additional overhead compared to components specifically designed for the web. This can lead to performance issues, particularly for complex applications.
    - **Optimization**: Web-optimized frameworks and libraries (like React DOM) are generally more performant for web-specific use cases.
2. **Limited Web Features**
    
    - **Web-Specific APIs**: React Native for Web might not support all web-specific APIs and features out-of-the-box, leading to potential limitations in accessing certain web functionalities.
    - **Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring compatibility across different browsers can be more challenging with React Native for Web compared to frameworks specifically designed for web development.
3. **Maturity and Ecosystem**
    
    - **Less Mature**: React Native for Web is relatively new compared to other web frameworks. It might lack some of the robustness and extensive community support found in mature web development tools.
    - **Ecosystem Gaps**: There may be gaps in the ecosystem, such as fewer third-party libraries and tools specifically designed for React Native for Web.
4. **Development Workflow**
    
    - **Mobile-centric Development**: React Native's development workflow is centered around mobile development. Adapting this workflow for web development might require additional adjustments and tooling.
    - **Styling and Layout**: While React Native uses a simplified styling approach (similar to CSS but not identical), complex web layouts might be harder to implement compared to using traditional CSS frameworks and methodologies.

### When Might React.js Be Acceptable for Mobile?

There are a few scenarios where building a mobile app with React.js might be acceptable:

- **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)**: PWAs are web applications that provide a more app-like experience with offline capabilities and can be added to the home screen. PWAs are suitable for simpler applications or when targeting both web and mobile platforms with a single codebase.
- **Internal Tools**: For internal tools or enterprise applications where performance and native look-and-feel are not critical, using React.js for mobile access might be a viable option.

## advantages of working with React native

- To avoid separate development, the logic layer can be reused to build the same app for both Android and iOS.
- React Native renders some code components with native APIs.
- If you know how to work with JavaScript, then you can easily work with React Native.
- To repair old applications, you only need to add React Native UI components, and there is no need to rewrite them.
- React Native adds React to applications, allowing easy use across various tools.

### Expo go and native

- Expo Go is an app that you can download to your phone to “see” your app in development.
    
- Expo CLI is a tool to build, manage and develop your apps.
    
- The Expo SDK is a set of modular packages that access native APIs such as Camera and Notifications.
    
- Expo Snack refers to a web-based playground. You can write and run React Native snippets in the browser.
    
    - how does it work
        
        Two important threads run in every React Native application:
        
        - One of them is the main thread, which runs in every standard native app. It displays the elements of the user interface and processes user gestures.
        - The second one is specific to React Native. Its function is to execute JavaScript code in a separate JavaScript engine. JavaScript is used to deal with the business logic of the app. It also defines the structure and functionality of the user interface
        
        these threads nev er communicate with eachother
        
    
    ### Conclusion
    
    **React** is a Javascript library responsible for building a hierarchy of UI components
    
    or **React Native** is a framework for building native applications using JavaScript. React Native compiles to native app components
    
    **Reactjs** is used for web and desktop apps and **React native for mobile development
    

## App to web

for this we can use [**React Native for Web**](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/)

React Native for Web is an accessible implementation of React Native's Components and APIs that is interoperable with React DOM → makes it possible to run [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev/) components and APIs on the web

It can be used in new and existing apps, web-only and multi-platform apps.

### how to add to a reactr native app

example for node js: Node.js can alias **`react-native`** to **`react-native-web`** using [**`module-alias`**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/module-alias). This is useful if you want to pre-render the app (e.g., server-side rendering or build-time rendering).

```jsx
const moduleAlias = require("module-alias");
moduleAlias.addAliases({
  "react-native": require.resolve("react-native-web"),
});
moduleAlias();
```

for other packages view [documentation](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs/setup/). 

# migrating to an app from React.js
## what is a PWA
To create a PWA that is as user-friendly as a platform-specific application, you need to design it so that it is high-performance, reliable, and installable
Progressive web apps (PWAs) are web applications designed and enhanced with modern APIs to offer enhanced functionality while reaching any web user on any device using from a single codebase. They combine the broad reach of web applications with the many features of platform-specific applications to enhance the user experience.

## converting a react app
this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/16pzx8g/is_there_a_goto_way_to_convert_your_react_app/) goes through the possibilities of this act. 
from it and other sources we can conclude the following
- You can do 90% of your development in the browser, with decent development tools. Previously I have released client projects with Expo/React Native and the DX is terrible
    
- Every update it feels like either RN or Expo breaks something. Capacitor feels a tad more stable, and it "syncs" with your XCode project. This is important to me, because it means XCode is doing the leg work around signing, validation, and deploying.
    
- Every improvement to our native app improves our mobile responsive version and vice versa. Bugs fixed in one are fixed in both.
    
- I'm going to say 95% of the codebase is shared between the web and mobile version. Only two areas needed to be altered - auth and payments. For these, its literally a ternary between two components - something like:
    
```jsx
     Capacitor.isNativePlatform() ? <NativeLogin /> : <WebLogin/>
```
    

Its not all rainbows of course!

- It doesn't feel as native. If I were starting from scratch, I would use Ionic on top of Capacitor to get some nicer sliding effects, etc
    
- It wouldn't be suitable for intensive games or apps
    
- It wouldn't be suitable where you need fine control over every aspect of the app or need to rely on very device specific behavior (though capacitor does expose a lot)

### problem 
- the app we're going to obtain is not uploadable on the stores, but we can include the link in the website to be able to download the app
- This is the way, [your app needs to follow some rules](https://web.dev/install-criteria/) in order to become installable as a PWA. It will have less capabilities (no file system access, only things you can do on the web) than a native app, so you'll need to think about whether that's an issue for your app.
# Solution: Using a capacitor
[Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) is an open source native runtime for building Web Native apps. Create cross-platform iOS, Android, and Progressive Web Apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
## using Ionic framework
Capacitor does not require [Ionic](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started/with-ionic) Framework in order to build apps. However, developers may find the [large collection](https://ionicframework.com/docs/components) of Ionic UI components helpful in order to build a high-quality app.

Capacitor can quickly be installed directly into any new or existing Ionic app by using the [Ionic CLI](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli)
