## Short answer

no we cannot do it directly.
we might be able to use a [capacitor](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/16pzx8g/is_there_a_goto_way_to_convert_your_react_app/). [View this](https://medium.com/how-to-react/convert-your-existing-react-js-app-to-android-or-ios-app-using-the-ionic-capacitor-a127deda75bd)


## What is the problem with the DOM?

the biggest problems of inserting elements into the [[Intro to react __Syntax__]] DOM with JavaScript is that the code is not reusable. For example, if you want to insert the same button into the page, but with different background colors, you have to create the element twice in JavaScript

## How React fixes it?

React is used to build all the parts of a website that the user can see and interact with on their browser window (front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.). React makes the process of designing the user interface much easier. It allows you to create elements that you can easily re-use in other parts of the website or app.

Another benefit of using React for UI development is separation of concerns. This means that the data used in a component exists separately from the logic, which exists separately from the view layer.

example:

```jsx
const Button (props) => {
	// component data
    const [btnText, setBtnText] = useState("Submit")
    
    // component logic
    function onClick() {
    	setBtnText("Submitted!")
    }
    
	return (
    	// component view
    	<div>
        	<button style={props.color}>{btnText}</button>
        </div>
    )
}
```

## Difference from React native

- React JS is used to build the user interface of web applications (that is, apps that run on a web browser)
- React Native is used to build applications that run on both iOS and Android devices (that is, cross-platform mobile applications)
- React uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create interactive user interfaces. React Native, on the other hand, uses native UI components and APIs to create mobile apps.

React Native was created as a way for developers to build cross-platform mobile applications using their existing knowledge of web development tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the React core library.

## advantages of working with React native

- To avoid separate development, the logic layer can be reused to build the same app for both Android and iOS.
- React Native renders some code components with native APIs.
- If you know how to work with JavaScript, then you can easily work with React Native.
- To repair old applications, you only need to add React Native UI components, and there is no need to rewrite them.
- React Native adds React to applications, allowing easy use across various tools.

### Expo go and native

- Expo Go is an app that you can download to your phone to “see” your app in development.
    
- Expo CLI is a tool to build, manage and develop your apps.
    
- The Expo SDK is a set of modular packages that access native APIs such as Camera and Notifications.
    
- Expo Snack refers to a web-based playground. You can write and run React Native snippets in the browser.
    
    - how does it work
        
        Two important threads run in every React Native application:
        
        - One of them is the main thread, which runs in every standard native app. It displays the elements of the user interface and processes user gestures.
        - The second one is specific to React Native. Its function is to execute JavaScript code in a separate JavaScript engine. JavaScript is used to deal with the business logic of the app. It also defines the structure and functionality of the user interface
        
        these threads nev er communicate with eachother
        
    
    ### Conclusion
    
    **React** is a Javascript library responsible for building a hierarchy of UI components
    
    or **React Native** is a framework for building native applications using JavaScript. React Native compiles to native app components
    
    **Reactjs** is used for web and desktop apps and **React native for mobile development
    

## App to web

for this we can use [**React Native for Web**](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/)

React Native for Web is an accessible implementation of React Native's Components and APIs that is interoperable with React DOM → makes it possible to run [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev/) components and APIs on the web

It can be used in new and existing apps, web-only and multi-platform apps.

### how to add to a reactr native app

example for node js: Node.js can alias **`react-native`** to **`react-native-web`** using [**`module-alias`**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/module-alias). This is useful if you want to pre-render the app (e.g., server-side rendering or build-time rendering).

```jsx
const moduleAlias = require("module-alias");
moduleAlias.addAliases({
  "react-native": require.resolve("react-native-web"),
});
moduleAlias();
```

for other packages view [documentation](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs/setup/). 

# migrating to an app from React.js
## what is a PWA
To create a PWA that is as user-friendly as a platform-specific application, you need to design it so that it is high-performance, reliable, and installable
Progressive web apps (PWAs) are web applications designed and enhanced with modern APIs to offer enhanced functionality while reaching any web user on any device using from a single codebase. They combine the broad reach of web applications with the many features of platform-specific applications to enhance the user experience.

## converting a react app
this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/16pzx8g/is_there_a_goto_way_to_convert_your_react_app/) goes through the possibilities of this act. 
from it and other sources we can conclude the following
- You can do 90% of your development in the browser, with decent development tools. Previously I have released client projects with Expo/React Native and the DX is terrible
    
- Every update it feels like either RN or Expo breaks something. Capacitor feels a tad more stable, and it "syncs" with your XCode project. This is important to me, because it means XCode is doing the leg work around signing, validation, and deploying.
    
- Every improvement to our native app improves our mobile responsive version and vice versa. Bugs fixed in one are fixed in both.
    
- I'm going to say 95% of the codebase is shared between the web and mobile version. Only two areas needed to be altered - auth and payments. For these, its literally a ternary between two components - something like:
    
```jsx
     Capacitor.isNativePlatform() ? <NativeLogin /> : <WebLogin/>
```
    

Its not all rainbows of course!

- It doesn't feel as native. If I were starting from scratch, I would use Ionic on top of Capacitor to get some nicer sliding effects, etc
    
- It wouldn't be suitable for intensive games or apps
    
- It wouldn't be suitable where you need fine control over every aspect of the app or need to rely on very device specific behavior (though capacitor does expose a lot)

### problem 
- the app we're going to obtain is not uploadable on the stores, but we can include the link in the website to be able to download the app
- This is the way, [your app needs to follow some rules](https://web.dev/install-criteria/) in order to become installable as a PWA. It will have less capabilities (no file system access, only things you can do on the web) than a native app, so you'll need to think about whether that's an issue for your app.
# Solution: Using a capacitor
[Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) is an open source native runtime for building Web Native apps. Create cross-platform iOS, Android, and Progressive Web Apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
## using Ionic framework
Capacitor does not require [Ionic](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started/with-ionic) Framework in order to build apps. However, developers may find the [large collection](https://ionicframework.com/docs/components) of Ionic UI components helpful in order to build a high-quality app.

Capacitor can quickly be installed directly into any new or existing Ionic app by using the [Ionic CLI](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli)
