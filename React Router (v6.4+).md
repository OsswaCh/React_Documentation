## Adding a router
  
 ![[Pasted image 20240712101652.png]]

what to add
```jsx
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider, } from "react-router-dom";
//rest of the code
const router = createBrowserRouter([ 
	{ path: "/",
	 element: <div>Hello world!</div>, 
	 }, ]);
//rest of the code
<React.StrictMode> 
	<RouterProvider router={router} /> 
</React.StrictMode>
```

>[!info] Root route
This first route is what we often call the "root route" since the rest of our routes will render inside of it. It will serve as the root layout of the UI, we'll have nested layouts as we get farther along.

## Not found errors
this happens when you type in an invalid 
**Set the `<ErrorPage>` as the [`errorElement`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/route/error-element) on the root route**

code to add 
```jsx
import ErrorPage from "./error-page";
//rest of code
const router = createBrowserRouter([ 
	{ path: "/", 
	element: <Root />, 
	errorElement: <ErrorPage />, //add this line of code
	 }, ]);
```

this or you can create your own error page component and insert it instead of <ErrorPage />

## Linking other pages
```jsx 
import Contact from "./routes/contact"; 
const router = createBrowserRouter([ 
{ 
 path: "/", 
 element: <Root />, 
 errorElement: <ErrorPage />, 
 }, 
 { 
 path: "contacts/:contactId", 
 element: <Contact />, 
 }, 
 ]);
```
Now if we click one of the links or visit `/contacts/1` we get our new component!

## [[nested route]]
```jsx 
const router = createBrowserRouter([ 
{ 
	path: "/", 
	element: <Root />, 
	errorElement: <ErrorPage />, 
	children: [ 
		{ 
			path: "contacts/:contactId", 
			element: <Contact />, 
			}, 
		], 
	}, ]);
```

 We need to tell the root route _where_ we want it to render its child routes. We do that with [[Outlet]](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/outlet)
